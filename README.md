# Charted
A text-based game inspired by Uncharted creating using C++ and SFML


## Introduction
This project revolves around obeying data structure patters and following its principles to the 
maximum extent. This application is inspired by the popular game, “Uncharted”. There are two 
characters in the game, the Enemy and a man named Drake. Another supporting character is 
introduced who is non-interactive. Drake is a man who discovers treasures for a living and the 
game begins on a screen where the female character, “Elena” and Drake are standing behind 
a door which opens up to the Lost City of Gold which they both were seeking. They found the 
city, and they open the door to enter it. The door leads to a bright shimmering golden city 
where Drake and Elena gasp in awe. Elena tells Drake that a more precious treasure awaits 
which is the Cursed Opal of La Llorona. As Elena reaches for the opal and grabs it, a witch 
appears with wings of gold, fair skin and black hair. She threatens Drake and Elena which is 
then followed by a fight scene. Elena is struck by the witch for daring to enter their sacred holy 
place and she faints. Drake fights with the witch and comes out victorious. This scene is rife 
with data structure principles and multiple data patterns are implemented such as Iterators, 
Arrays, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. 

Once the witch dies, Drake gets weak and faints. Elena wakes him up quickly as the entire 
city starts sinking to the ground. They both rush to the door but it is closed. They cannot climb 
up the door due to its large size and Drake’s injury.

They both split up to find the key for the door. Drake goes through rooms to find the keys and 
observes objects. Multiple scenarios occur here such as being bitten by a deadly insect and 
finding a ring which screams noises in the person’s ear who wears it. Drake also finds healing 
potions and bandages to treat his injuries. The objects he finds are saved in the collection and 
can be equipped to use later. 

In a room, Drake finds a stack of keys and saves them one by one in the inventory. Then he 
goes to the door to try unlocking the big gate with those keys and finally when the right key is 
added in the keyhole, the gate unlocks and Drake and Elena escape before the entire city 
turns to dust.

This is a text-based game where the player’s visual urges are satisfied by implementing ASCII 
art in the game. SFML is implemented to enhance the user experience. A music 
function is introduced which plays the background music of the game on loop 
as long as the game is running.
